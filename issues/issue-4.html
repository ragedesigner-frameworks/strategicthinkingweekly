            <h3>The Sales Rep Who Didn't Know He Had a Framework</h3>
            
            <p>Sebastian had been doing bilingual sales consultations for years before we started working together. His close rate was consistently higher than his peers. When I asked him what made him effective, he shrugged.</p>
            
            <p>"I don't know. I just talk to people."</p>
            
            <p>But when we recorded his calls and broke them down, a clear pattern emerged. He always started with a specific type of question. He transitioned to the offer at a predictable moment. He handled objections in a particular sequence.</p>
            
            <p>He had a framework. He'd been using it for years. He just never wrote it down.</p>
            
            <p>Once we documented it, something interesting happened. Not only could he explain it to new team members, but he got better himself. Seeing the pattern explicitly let him refine it intentionally instead of relying on instinct alone.</p>
            
            <p>That's framework archaeology: excavating the systematic thinking that's already producing results, so you can understand it, improve it, and transfer it.</p>

            <p class="section-label">Deep Dive</p>
            <h3>Why Your Best Work Already Contains Frameworks</h3>
            
            <p>Here's what most people miss: if you're consistently good at something, you're already using a framework. You're just not conscious of it.</p>
            
            <p>Psychologists call this "unconscious competence." You've internalized a pattern so deeply that you execute it automatically. Great for efficiency. Terrible for improvement and transfer.</p>
            
            <p>Framework archaeology reverses this. You dig into what you're already doing well and extract the underlying structure. The benefits compound:</p>
            
            <p><strong>You can teach it.</strong> Tacit knowledge stays locked in one person's head. Explicit frameworks spread across teams. Sebastian went from "I just talk to people" to training three new reps in his first month.</p>
            
            <p><strong>You can improve it.</strong> You can't optimize what you can't see. Once the framework is visible, you can test variations, identify weak spots, and strengthen specific components.</p>
            
            <p><strong>You can transfer it.</strong> A framework extracted from sales might apply to customer support. A pattern from project management might work in personal planning. The structure travels even when the context changes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>You can automate it.</strong> AI needs explicit instructions. Tacit knowledge produces vague prompts and generic outputs. Documented frameworks become precise inputs that generate consistent results.</p>

            <h3>Extracting a Blog Production Framework</h3>
            
            <div class="case-study">
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Marketing team at a professional services firm</p>
                <p><strong>Situation:</strong> One team member consistently produced high-quality blog posts in half the time of others. When asked how, she said "I just write." The team wanted to capture her approach.</p>
                <p><strong>Constraint:</strong> She couldn't articulate her process because it had become automatic. We had to observe and extract rather than interview.</p>
                <p><strong>Intervention:</strong> Recorded her screen during three blog sessions. Documented every action, including pauses, research moments, and revision patterns. Mapped the sequence into a repeatable framework.</p>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Blog production time dropped 60% across the team (from 45 minutes average to 18 minutes). New hires reached quality standards in their first week instead of their first month.</p>
                
                <div class="notable">
                    <p><strong>What's notable here:</strong> The framework was already there, producing results every time she wrote. The archaeology didn't create something new. It made the invisible visible. Once visible, it became transferable, improvable, and scalable. The constraint (she couldn't explain it) forced observation-based extraction, which actually produced a more accurate framework than self-reporting would have.</p>

                <h3>Signs You Have a Hidden Framework Worth Excavating</h3>
                
                <p><strong>1. Consistent results in a specific domain</strong><br>
                If you're reliably good at something, there's a pattern. Even if you think you're "just doing it naturally," nature has structure.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Others ask how you do it</strong><br>
                When people notice your results and want to understand your approach, they're seeing a framework you can't see yourself.</p>
                
                <p><strong>3. You say "I just..." when explaining</strong><br>
                "I just talk to people." "I just write." "I just figure it out." These phrases signal unconscious competence. Something systematic is happening beneath the surface.</p>
                
                <p><strong>4. You can do it tired or distracted</strong><br>
                If you can execute well even when your conscious mind is elsewhere, you've automated a pattern. That pattern is a framework waiting to be documented.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5. New people struggle where you succeed easily</strong><br>
                If others find difficult what you find effortless, you've internalized something they haven't. That something has structure worth capturing.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">Excavate one framework from your own work</p>
                
                <p><strong>Pick something you do well consistently</strong><br>
                Not your most impressive skill. Something you do regularly where others sometimes struggle but you don't. Running meetings. Writing emails. Handling a specific type of request.</p>
                
                <p><strong>List your actual steps</strong><br>
                Not what you think you should do. What you actually do. Start from the trigger ("When I need to...") and walk through the sequence. Include the small things you might dismiss as obvious.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Look for the decision points</strong><br>
                Where do you make choices? What information do you check? What determines which path you take? These decision points are the skeleton of your framework.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Name it</strong><br>
                Give your excavated framework a name. "My email triage system." "The meeting opener sequence." Naming makes it real, memorable, and teachable.</p>
                
                <p>You've just done framework archaeology. That pattern was always there. Now you can see it, improve it, and share it.</p>
