            <h3>From Federal Contracting to Medical Advocacy</h3>
            
            <p>I spent years building frameworks for federal contracting. Government sales, compliance processes, proposal systems. Very specific domain.</p>
            
            <p>Then someone asked me to help with a medical advocacy situation. Completely different world. Healthcare systems, insurance negotiations, patient rights. I had zero domain expertise.</p>
            
            <p>But the framework architecture transferred perfectly.</p>
            
            <p>The SCEPTER protocol I'd developed for analyzing federal opportunities worked just as well for analyzing medical situations. Surface the real problem. Cross-examine assumptions. Explore adjacent options. Predict implications. The structure didn't care about the content.</p>
            
            <p>That's when I understood something fundamental: frameworks aren't about knowing a domain. They're about structuring thinking. And thinking structures travel.</p>

            <p class="section-label">Deep Dive</p>
            <h3>Why Domain Expertise Is Overrated (And Pattern Recognition Is Underrated)</h3>
            
            <p>Most people believe you need deep domain expertise to solve domain problems. Sometimes that's true. But often the opposite is true: outsiders with transferable frameworks outperform insiders with domain knowledge.</p>
            
            <p>Research on innovation consistently shows that breakthrough solutions frequently come from people working outside the problem's original domain. Why? Because insiders are trapped by domain assumptions. Outsiders bring fresh patterns.</p>
            
            <p>The TRIZ methodology analyzed over 2 million patents and found that most inventions apply solutions from other fields. The innovative step wasn't creating something new. It was recognizing that a solution from Domain A could solve a problem in Domain B.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What makes frameworks transferable:</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>They operate at the structural level.</strong> A decision-making framework doesn't care if you're deciding about hiring or purchasing or treatment options. The structure of good decisions is consistent.</p>
            
            <p><strong>They separate content from process.</strong> The SCEPTER protocol doesn't know anything about federal contracting or healthcare. It knows how to systematically analyze complex situations. The domain provides content; the framework provides process.</p>
            
            <p><strong>They capture universal patterns.</strong> Constraint-driven innovation works the same way whether you're constrained by budget, time, regulations, or physical laws. The pattern is universal; only the specific constraint changes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>They create consistent language.</strong> When you have a framework, you have vocabulary. That vocabulary travels. "What's the judgment gate here?" works in any domain once someone knows what a judgment gate is.</p>

            <p class="section-label">Case Slice Teardown</p>
            <h3>Sales Framework Becomes Content Framework</h3>
            
            <div class="case-study">
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Marketing team transitioning from sales support to content production</p>
                <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Team had strong sales frameworks but struggled with content creation. Blog posts were inconsistent, took too long, and didn't convert.</p>
                <p><strong>Constraint:</strong> No budget for content training. Had to work with existing team capabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Intervention:</strong> Mapped the sales framework onto content production. "Qualify the lead" became "qualify the topic." "Handle objections" became "address reader resistance." "Close" became "call to action." Same structure, different application.</p>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Blog production time dropped 60%. Content quality improved because writers understood the underlying logic. The team didn't learn content marketing. They transferred what they already knew.</p>
                
                <div class="notable">
                    <p><strong>What's notable here:</strong> The team didn't need new knowledge. They needed to recognize that their existing knowledge applied. The sales framework was already a content framework. They just hadn't seen the translation. Cross-domain transfer isn't about learning more. It's about recognizing what you already know in unfamiliar contexts.</p>

                <h3>The Transfer Test: Making Your Frameworks Portable</h3>
                
                <p><strong>1. Can you explain it without domain jargon?</strong><br>
                If your framework requires industry-specific vocabulary to explain, it's not portable. The underlying structure should be expressible in plain language.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Does it describe a process or just content?</strong><br>
                "Always include pricing on page 2" is content-specific. "Put the most decision-relevant information where attention peaks" is a transferable process.</p>
                
                <p><strong>3. Would someone from a different industry understand the logic?</strong><br>
                Show your framework to someone outside your field. If they can grasp why each step exists, the framework travels. If they're confused, you've embedded domain assumptions.</p>
                
                <p><strong>4. Can you name the universal pattern?</strong><br>
                Every portable framework implements a universal pattern: constraint-driven innovation, progressive commitment, trust calibration, etc. If you can't name the pattern, you might have a procedure instead of a framework.</p>

                <h3>3-Minute Micro-Win</h3>
                <p class="subtitle">Transfer a framework you already use</p>
                
                <p><strong>Pick a framework from your strongest domain</strong><br>
                Something you use regularly and well. A sales process. A project management approach. A decision-making method. Whatever you're most fluent in.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Strip out the domain-specific language</strong><br>
                Replace every industry term with a generic description. "Qualify the prospect" becomes "determine fit before investing effort." "Sprint planning" becomes "scope work to capacity before starting."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Apply it to a completely different area</strong><br>
                Take your generalized framework and map it onto something unrelated. Personal decisions. A hobby. A household process. See how the structure fits.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Notice what transfers and what doesn't</strong><br>
                Some elements will map perfectly. Others will need adaptation. The elements that transfer easily are the universal patterns. The elements that don't might be domain-specific content masquerading as structure.</p>
                
                <p>You've just practiced cross-domain transfer. This skill compounds. The more you practice seeing patterns across contexts, the more portable your thinking becomes.</p>
